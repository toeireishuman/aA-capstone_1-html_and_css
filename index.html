            <p>Memory capturer, uses memory as an art form, memory capture and restoration to help people recover lost
                memories and contribute to recovering lost knowledge of human history.</p>

                <p>
                    I am a memory medium, which means having the ability to recall the past. I capture them through
                    photograph, video, or as live memory that I can mentally transmit to my clients.

                <p>
                    I also work with a team of archaeologists and historians. I help them discover past truths about
                    humanity. Since history is no one's property, all of my work that I gained for the university is
                    freely
                    accessible. If some institutions are barring my work and forcing you to pay, redirect to my website
                    to
                    view them for free.
                </p>

                <h2 class="serif">Memory Art</h2>
                <p>
                    All of my art has no physical form, and can only be transmitted as thought. They
                    are also mainly inspired by the work I do for others to help them gain lost memories and for the
                    lost
                    history of humanity.
                    That's why, like my work as a restorer, all of my work as an artist is also free. Reach out if
                    you want to see some of it!
