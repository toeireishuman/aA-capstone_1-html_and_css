            <p>
                I am a memory medium, which means having the ability to recall the past. I capture them through
                photograph, video, or as live memory that I can mentally transmit to my clients.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2 class="serif">Memory Restoration</h2>
            <p>
                I also work with a team of archaeologists and historians. I help them discover past truths about
                humanity. Since history is no one's property, all of my work that I gained for the university is freely
                accessible. If some institutions are barring my work and forcing you to pay, redirect to my website to
                view them for free.
            </p>

            <h2 class="serif">Memory Art</h2>
            <p>
                All of my art has no physical form, and can only be transmitted as thought. They
                are also mainly inspired by the work I do for others to help them gain lost memories and for the lost
                history of humanity.
                That's why, like my work as a restorer, all of my work as an artist is also free. Reach out if
                you want to see some of it!
