            <h2>Memory Capture</h2>
            <p>
                I am a memory medium, which means having the ability to recall the past. I capture them through
                photograph, video, or as live memory that I can mentally transmit to my clients.

            <h2>Thought Art</h2>
            <p>
                I also work with a team of archaeologists and historians. I help them discover past truths about
                humanity, but I am also inspired by them to what I like calling "though art". See the appropriate links
                to view them. Since history is no one's property, all of my work is freely accessible.

            <p>
                Hi! I'm Alex. I see myself as an artist whose medium is memory, but my ability, memory capture, is also
                my trade,
                which I use to help everyone. If you're curious about memory as an artform or memory capture as a trade,
                please
                reach out! I'm happy to help.
            </p>
